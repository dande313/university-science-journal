Bugs in Github pulled random files from other projects into this repo. I am so sorry for the confusion. If you follow the path down from desktop to "scientific-journal", that is where the project is located.

I created a new repo for this project, which does not have the logs of my commits, but is a clean and working directory. You can find it at https://github.com/dande313/university-science-journal-V2.
